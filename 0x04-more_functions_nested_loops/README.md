# 0x04 - C - More functions, more nested loops

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do I use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra`
* What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`
